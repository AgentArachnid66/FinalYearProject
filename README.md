# FinalYearProject
 
This project will be looking into how to effectively use a Virtual Environment to train procedural memory to solve real world problems and improve practical skills in players. The main focus of the project is how to treat all degrees of burns. 

Where I feel a lot of educational games go wrong is that they focus too much on the educational section of the genre. I think that a new approach is needed in that the teaching should be integrated into the game rather than the game integrated into the education.
