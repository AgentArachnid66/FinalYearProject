# FinalYearProject
 
This project will be looking into how to effectively use a VR environment to train procedural memory to solve real world problems and improve practical skills in players. It will be using a neural network to take the output of a Leap Motion controller to see what hand shape the player is making and to make an assertion as to if the player's doing it correctly. 

Where I feel a lot of educational games go wrong is that they focus too much on the educational section of the genre. I think that a new approach is needed in that the teaching should be integrated into the game rather than the game integrated into the education.
